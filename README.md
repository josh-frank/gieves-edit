# Mr. Gieves

Mr. Gieves is a basic SVG path editor. It's intended for dressmaking/tailoring/sewing/fashion patterns but can also serve in a limited capacity for general-purpose editing of SVG paths.

It will hopefully one day work with a back end yet to be written, which will accept measurement requests and respond with pattern pieces for several garments represented as SVG paths, using algorithms adapted from various sewing manuals of the 19th & 20th centuries.

Mr. Gieves was written by [Josh Frank](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

## Paths

Current paths can be viewed in the artboard. Paths can be de/activated with a click in any mode; the current active path is highlit in red with red handles. Up to one path can be activated at a time.

## Menu

Collapse the menu with the ‚ñ∂/‚óÄ button on the left of the screen.

### Mode panel

Use the Mode panel to select a mode.

#### üé• Pan

In Pan mode, click-dragging the mouse will pan the artboard across the screen, and scrolling will zoom in/out according to wheel direction.

#### üëÜ Path

In Path mode, click and drag a red **handle** to move it. You can edit either **point handles** where two edges meet or the connected **curve handles** which control curve direction and flow.

### Path panel

Whenever a path is activated, use the path panel to edit the path directly by typing changes into the edit field. Then click **Save**, or **Revert** to clear edits.

### Transform panel

Click the **Absolute** and **Relative** buttons to convert the active path between absolute and relative definitions. 

Click the **Normalize** button to normalize the path (convert all shapes to cubic b√©ziers).

Use the **Translate** button/fields to translate a path (move it up/down or left/right). Specify the X/Y distance in the relevant field to the right of the button. Use the **Scale** button/fields to grow/shrink a path in the same way.

Click the **Snap** button to snap the active path's points to the artboard's gridlines. Set the gridlines in the **artboard info** panel.

## Artboard Info

At any time you can directly edit some artboard settings in the **artboard info** panel at the bottom right of the screen:
- ü§ö The artboard's offset from the center (set automatically when the app starts to center the artboard in the viewport/window)
- üìè The artboard's width/height
- a toggle button for hiding/showing the grid
- a field to define gridline interval
