# Mr. Gieves

Mr. Gieves is a basic SVG path editor. It is intended for creating fashion/tailoring/sewing patterns, to be scaled and printed; however, it can also be used in a limited capacity for general-purpose editing of simple SVG shapes.

It will also hopefully one day work with a back end yet to be written, which will accept measurement requests and respond with SVG pattern pieces for several garments, using algorithms adapted from various sewing manuals of the 19th & 20th centuries.

Jeeves was written by [Josh Frank](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
